      <h1>About Me</h1>
      <p>Hello! I'm Viet, a recent graduate from the Northern Alberta Institute of Technology (NAIT), where I specialized in web development. Over the past few years, both inside and outside the classroom, I've dedicated myself to honing my skills in this dynamic field</p>
      <p>During my time at NAIT, I undertook numerous projects that provided me with invaluable hands-on experience with various web development technologies. One of the most notable projects I contributed to was UrbanBazzar, a collaborative effort where my team and I developed a responsive e-commerce website from scratch. My role encompassed designing the frontend layout using HTML and CSS, as well as implementing client-side interactivity with JavaScript. This project not only deepened my understanding of web development principles but also honed my ability to work effectively within a team environment, meeting deadlines and delivering quality results.</p>
      <p>In addition to my academic endeavors, I actively pursued freelance opportunities to gain real-world experience. For instance, I had the privilege of creating website for my aunt beaute business where I had the opportunity to assist the development in building and maintaining web applications for a diverse range of clients. This experience was instrumental in allowing me to apply my theoretical knowledge to real-world scenarios, while also familiarizing myself with industry best practices and standards.</p>
      <p>Outside of my academic and professional pursuits, I'm deeply passionate about designing,a craft that demands precision and attention to detailâ€”qualities that resonate deeply with me. I find joy in meticulously designing intricate patterns and experimenting with color combinations, constantly seeking to elevate my skills and techniques.</p>
      <p>In summary, my journey through NAIT and my subsequent experiences have equipped me with a robust foundation in web development, coupled with practical skills and a strong work ethic. I'm eager to leverage these assets to contribute meaningfully to innovative projects and continue my growth as a professional in the field.</p>
